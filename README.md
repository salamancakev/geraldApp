# Gerald Navigation App

## Description
This is a simple react-native app used to demonstrate the different types of navigators from the react-navigation library.

It consists of 3 navigators:
- A drawer navigator, which is composed by two components: a bottom tab navigator, and the "Contact" component
- A bottom tab navigator, which includes two components: a HomeStackNavigator and the "Contact" component
- A stack navigator called HomeStackNavigator, which has 3 components: Home, Cart and Orders

The application combines these 3 to allow the user to navigate through the app screens through multiple methods

The drawer was supposed to include an animation, similar to the one shown in the challenge's description. However, due to time constrains and inexperience with the react-native-reanimated library, I ended up using the default animation from react-navigation

Below you will find a quick video demonstrating the app's functionality
